        <p> My professor sucks. She's like really bad at teaching and boring. TOO BAD. The course material is subjective, 
            the textbook and content is set therefore all you need to do is read it. If you fail a class because the teacher can't teach, 
            just admit that you are not smart enough. Now this may sound rather harsh, HOWEVER, that is only if you consider intellect as the goal,
             only if you correlate intelligence with self-worth. I believe self-awareness to be the most important aspect of life, and I also believe 
             I am not very smkjart. This is not a self-pitying or self-hating statement. It is not a bad thing to not be smart because I believe intelligence 
            to be overrated.
            
            <p>Call it good grades, call it very introspective, faithful, resourceful, flexible, creative, having a 600+ chess.com rating, etc. 
                These are all metacognitive abilities that have been valued at some point at varying relative degrees. This is because people have very 
                much concerned themselves with the nasty goal of “being the best version of themselves”. Now the first question is: does this qualify the 
                existence of alternate realities consisting of numerous versions of people? Maybe it would only be in imagination, but isn't that enough to create 
                an alternate dimension anyways? Think Harry Potter. Essentially fabricated from thinking really really hard somewhere in the UK and now it is a 
                multi-billion dollar corporation (I have no source for this but I think it is true) and random ticktockers will chant mantras before bed every 
                night in order to dream shift into Hogwarts wherein they have hypothetical relationships with characters.</p>
            
            <p>Anyways back to the point.</p>
            
            <p>“Being the best version of oneself”. Perhaps there is some The Alchemist-esque purpose in life you are yearning for. I believe this to 
                be much like holidays, they are arbitrarily scattered throughout the year because it's Christian, or a memorial, or Native genocide HOWEVER 
                nobody is actually interested in the commemoration, they are interested because it is a bank holiday. Therefore… I forgot what I was talking about.
            </p>
            <p>Anyways</p>
            
            <p>Dualism. My arm, my foot, my corporeal body belongs to me therefore the self is in the mind. But where is my mind, yes it's your brain. But where 
                is the thinking domain? This is a rather interesting tidbit of psychology because although neural activity may be seen with technology, mental life, 
                memory, dreams cannot be pixelated therefore it must exist in an immaterial realm of imagination separate from the body. But the counter is does 
                damage to the body affect the mind? Sometimes yes through like trauma and stuff, sometimes no like when I fell off my bike last week and bloodied 
                my hand. I forgot what I was talking about. </p>
            
            <p>Anyways back to bank holidays.</p>
            
            <p>They are arbitrary dates scattered throughout the calendar to make people look forward to the next holiday, to have another office party  
                because birthday parties are too sparse and depressing. Therefore I believe finding a purpose in life is very similar to a bank holiday in this 
                manner. It is non-essential but could be essential if you lack a reason to live. </p>
            
            <p>Anyways trying to market yourself as the best version is like Tropicana changing their logo, like changing avatar skins,changing the font of your 
                resume in the hopes of looking more appealing on a shelf of a grocery store with harsh fluorescent lights reminiscent of a hospital with incoherent 
                mumblings over the PA system. Basically it's all just a great big scheme of the evil beast called Capitalism in which people are intrinsically 
                motivated to be the best piece of meat on the market.</p>
            
            <p>Anyways, it is not a bad thing to not be smart.</p>
