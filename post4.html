        <p>	    OMG, a new Spiderman movie just came out! But is it really new if it is just the same story over and over 
            again? Spider-man: Into the Spider-verse literally capitalizes on the fact that there are a million stories 
            about the same thing. But this new one has insane surround-sound audio and the black is true black 4k HDR! 
            Perhaps all these big action movies are moreso a means of demonstrating new hardware since all the stories 
            have been told already, nowadays it is just a superficial marketing battle for profit rather than to convey 
            some raw emotion or idea. Is there really nothing else worth saying that there can only be remixes and copies,
             can anything be genuinely new anymore? This leads to the big philosophical debate on the concept of newness, 
             the question to end all cheesy movie franchises and discourage all young and budding writers. Nowadays movies
              all seem to share the same plot structure, the Hero's Story or Freytag's Pyramid, it seems impossible to 
              make anything new since everything is at least partially inspired by something or someone else. But, while 
              originality (to be distinct from plagiarism)  is important in creativity, it is not the high judge that 
              deems whether or not something is “good” media. Entertainment media should entertain, and while intellectual 
              property is important to creators, it is more essential that plays and films should resonate with the audience and the times. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Take the chick-flick shrine figurehead 10 Things I Hate About You released in 1999, which is said to be lifted 
            directly from Shakespeare's play The Taming of the Shrew written over 400 years prior. The movie is heavily 
            influenced by the play with the school being named Padua High, the strategic naming of the Stratford sisters, 
            and at love at first sight, the parallel character dramatizes, “I burn, I pine, I perish” (1.1.157) taken 
            right out of the play. But with the popularity and adoration of the film it must be much more than some 
            modern English translations and chunky flip-flops. The film proves to be much more different than the 
            out-dated Shakespeare play in the same sense that daily life in the 21st century harshly differs from daily 
            life in the obsolete Elizabethan era. They are not by any means completely foreign from each other, but significant 
            differences lie in the social 
            context and plot of the film. Firstly, the film actually fights against the notions of patriarchy and misogyny of 
            the play, and secondly, the plot is subsequently affected by the way and means that the characters interact with 
            each other. Nonetheless, while it is important to note that compared to the play, 10 Things I Hate About You is new, 
            on the other hand, within the modern genre amongst the film's adaptation peers, for example, Clueless (1995), or She's 
            All That (1999), the culture of the story, the character tropes, and the plot structure are much less new. Therefore 
            it is important to emphasize that the context and scope of time are important factors in the debate of ‘newness'. But 
            between feathered hats and Prada bags, the film is not as simple as a dressed-up and plagiarized remix of The Taming 
            of the Shrew, the movie really is new through the restructuring of the plot in relation to current social structures, 
            which paints a very different perspective of the story through modern feminist complexes compared to the strong 
            misogynistic tones of the play.

            <p>
                Let's begin analyzing each piece chronologically, in order to see from the perspective of time. Katherine is pushed 
            into a marriage with Petruchio, an outsider who only cares to marry a hefty dowry, no matter the woman. He tames her 
            unruly behavior by denying her food, drink, sleep, and taunting her. While dangling luxurious clothing in front of 
            her face, Katherine proves her resolve by passionately proclaiming “my tongue will tell the anger of my heart, or 
            else my heart, concealing it, will break” (4.3.82-83). Petruchio forcefully snatches the reins of the marriage by 
            asserting his dictatorial power but Katherine fights for her resolve proving she is of no malleable spirit. This 
            conflict between Katherine and Petruchio is built upon the structure of a patriarchal household and the 
            objectification of women. The social climate of the time was imbued into the plot, there is no forced marriage 
            without patriarchal reverence, no 'taming' without misogyny. This illustrated relationship could never conscientiously
             connect with a modern audience with just a few well-planned set and costume updates. Just imagine how quickly a 
             man wearing a Patagonia quarter-zip would get canceled for saying “thou must be married to no man but me, for I am 
             he am born to tame you, Kate, And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate, conformable as other household Kates” 
             (2.1.290-293). Comical, but pentameter or not, the message would never become a chick-flick staple. Instead, 
             this out-dated play would need some heavy-handed alterations in order to relate to the modern audience. Therefore, 
             holding up the plot of the play and the film next to each other again emphasizes the importance of the time period 
             when discussing the concept of newness. </p>

                The modern Katherine is introduced with Joan Jett, feminist rock icon, screaming “I don't give a damn 'bout my 
            reputation” (0:15-0:17). She hates highschool, hates prom, and hates douchebag men. Through a convoluted plan, 
            the menacing outcast, Patrick Verona, is paid to woo Katherine so that douchebag Joey can seal the deal with Bianca. 
            Throughout the movie, Katherine tabletop dances at a party, wears her mother's pearls to prom, and finally, falls in 
            love with Patrick. Her initial stubbornness is melted by Patrick's nonchalant humor and kindness, very much unlike 
            Petruchio's rampage of starvation and sleep deprivation. The movie is regarded as a feminist film, illustrating the 
            transition from second to third wave feminism (45 Friedman). Katherine is not any less of an independent woman by 
            attending prom and no less strong-willed for forgiving Patrick. This feminism is about freely expressing oneself 
            and about holding others accountable, and so Katherine ending up with Patrick was freeing, whereas Katherine ending 
            up with Petruchio was suppression. While the influence from the play is apparent in the film, it is only in the 
            superficial exposition of the characters, both Katherines are sharp-tongued and opinionated while both Biancas are 
            apparently gentle and sweet. In adapting to a modern audience, the “original” plot was completely reconstructed to 
            support the liberal social structure free from the archaic notion of marrying for the main purpose of social and 
            economic gain. Perhaps the argument that 10 Things I Hate About You is not new may find more similarities in both 
            the daughters' rebellious natures, however this rebellious streak against social and parental pressures is more so 
            repetitive in all teenage girls of all time, rather than just in the context of the play and film. Therefore despite 
            some inspirations from play, the film is still a new story because it builds a new message upon completely different 
            social structures.</p>
            <p>
                    The question of whether some piece of media is new has been under debate for years. However, what does it matter 
                that something is new or not? If there is another Spiderman movie in theaters, many people would still go watch 
                it regardless if there were a million Spiderman stories already told. More than a debate of originality, the 
                question of newness matters because it allows people to understand the similarities and differences over the 
                context of time, to investigate if history really is repeating itself over and over again. For example, how 
                far has society progressed in the past 400 years from its patriarchal values, or how has human behavior been 
                affected by changes in social structures, like in the context of feminist movements. It is comforting to find 
                that punk rock girls like Katherine Stratford existed even in the 1500s. But only after seeing the changes in 
                10 Things I Hate About You and being able to see how far society has progressed over the ages, life today really 
                does seem like a whole new world.
