<h4>the truth of the youth</h4>
<p>My favorite Shakespeare book is Romeo & Juliet because they both grow up in the end. Childhood is the greatest practical 
joke that all the embittered adults like to take part in. They make up this fantasy world of lollipops (the big round 
swirly ones) and Peppa Pig and shelter us from the real world of work parties and genocides and such and then with curfew 
and chores they charge rent like the evil landlords that they are. These practical jokers act like the real world is the 
only place where things can matter, that we should enjoy childhood simulation before we get to the real world. Montessori 
School (literally the new child-factory corporation) says that children need a safe and nurturing environment to grow and 
learn to trust adults when they inevitably run into problems they can't solve. Children are diminished with naivety and 
gullibility; while conversely adults are matured with sarcasm and bitterness. And so adults generate this temporary 
fantasy, this separation of childhood and the real world in order to protect children for as long as possible. They 
idolize childhood innocence and gatekeep the real world like Holden Caulfield trying to stop children from turning 
into a bunch of phonies who don't ever really listen to what you're saying.</p>

<h4>the defense of the youth</h4>>
<p>Think Edward Scissorhands, Kim dancing in the snow. An angel, white dress, purity accentuated by the dark and lonesome monster. Socially and politically we value innocence. Who deserves the last loaf, the innocent man or the man trying to be innocent. A complete lack of wickedness, sin, and ill-intent. So completely unambitious and humble, the goodest, most innocent person. In other words, the antithesis of the natural man, it is a constant battle to be selfless. We are good because society rewards good people, because we hope for good things to come back around, because we hope to accumulate positive social credit, maybe even because God told us to love thy neighbor. (am i supposed to cite the Bible?) Some say that children are born innocent; that they they are born having done no wrong and therefore maintain an absence of wickedness. However it is only that they are limited by a terribly miniature stature and embarrassing hand-eye coordination. What if people were born adults? Like artificial people. Take Frankenstein's monster. A newborn entering the world fully adult with capability of thought and physical ability, though still lacking comprehension, common sense, and experience (Kakoudaki). He murders 6 people. In a sense isn't he innocent? He is naive, lashing out after rejection, he is just a child.
</p>
<h4>citizens to terrorize, generations to desensitize</h4>
<p>
But then what is society that values innocence supposed to be like? A completely censored world? Avoidance of sex-talks, 
shunning of exposed collarbones, abhorrence of curse words? (LORE moment: It actually was like this for a period of time 
until they released Dirty Dancing). Or should lewd videos and vulgar vocabulary be exposed early to youths? No. Innocence 
should be protected so that depravity and filth maintains its terribleness. A dystopian world desensitized to the value 
of innocence doesn't lessen the limits of purity and wickedness; it pushes them further, towards more extreme 
monstrosities:
</p>

<p>
Using children's simpleness to snitch on their parents to the Thought Police when they make off-handed comments about 
the government and essentially turn them into “child-hero eavesdropping sneaks”(Orwell).
Genetically altering their intelligence and capabilities while still in embryonic state and then placing them into a 
predetermined hierarchical system so they become more efficient workers (Huxley).
Vaguely directing a large hoard of children on an unsupervised religious recruiting field trip to the Holy Land in 1212 
that was embarrassingly unsuccessful (Catholic Church) irl lore jump-scare. 
</p>
<p>
Let's “do it for the children”, the apolitical yet extremely sympathetic demographic (Harvard), and use their innocence to create social and political change!
