        <h4>Exponentially advancing technology</h4>

    <main>
        <p>	Currently our foes include iPad kids, Elon Musk, and evil AI robots trying to claw their way out of the 
            uncanny valley. Now, most futuristic movies are kind of sad, like Blade Runner, they're usually warnings of 
            rampant technology and the downfall of humanity; which I do think will eventually come to happen (I'm like 
            78% sure). It will be a time of constant war and conflict, huge fancy laser guns or like mecha soldiers, maybe. 
            Since a 
            robot will be able to perform many human-esque functions, the humanity in robots will come into question 
            parallel with the animalism in humans as the "superior-species" comes into question. Think: robots that are better 
            able to recognize a child in a war-torn 
            country as opposed to trigger-happy soldiers, or like Paul doing the gom jabbar test 
            #italreadyhappenedinDune. So basically the future will be bad for a certain period of time. 
            </p>
            <h4>Esentially Human</h4>
            <p>
                As humans become closer to robots (bc of capitalism) and robots become more like humans, there will 
                be a decline of highly emotional, human-esque elements aka frivolity (like art and stuff) as seen in 
                architectural modernism and sans serif fonts. This would be much more efficient I think, but is generally 
                seen as bad for some reason, but these essentially human emotions are so highly regarded allowing the 
                power of love to save the world, (like Harry Potter. Or My Little Pony), a common and boring cop-out 
                used in films. Well if losing these human emotions is so bad, do we stop or somehow hinder the advancement 
                of technology since it is so evil? No. Because technology improves our lives in many ways. Like how Tiktok 
                knows which Vinnie Hacker videos to put into my feed (I like the car ones). So anyways,how do we prevent 
                technology from destroying our lives? Humans will need to ground themselves in a constantly volatile world, 
                they will need to establish themselves within the matrix. And it will be through religion. Yes, the true 
                religion. Or call it spirituality, if the word religion has been sullied by money laundering Catholic 
                churches for you. 
                </p>
                <h4>The True Religion</h4>
            <p>
                Anyways, they will base these societies on a religion with a foundation of very strong divine and 
                metaphysical connection to their surroundings. People will no longer be able to manipulate nuclear 
                energy for their evil side-quests because people won't understand it as technology, something tamperable 
                by sticky human hands. No. It is magic, a manifestation of spiritual devotion to the greater being, be 
                it a singular figure or the collective peoples themselves. This magic is left unknown and essentially 
                greater than any human. Godly, untouchable. Yes, this great spirituality will stop humans from preying 
                on one another, and it is very much like the Avatar. 
            </p>
            <h4>Avatar</h4>
             <p>
                Tsaheylu (the hair thing) is essentially a neural connection. Very plausible if you consider it is a 
                very advanced neural connection that could allow two brains to communicate through synapses and 
                rudimentary neural impulses without room for misinterpretation through language and culture, it is pure 
                intent not obscured by human formalities or notions. The Tree of Souls is just like a national 
                centralized database. (I could have sworn I read somewhere that the US was gonna make this big black 
                box physically capable of housing an entire nation's worth of data. But I can't find the article now. 
                Strange). Anyways, these very mythical things, such as a connection to surroundings and respecting 
                nature, concepts completely foreign to the modern-day human seem like magic. But what is magic if not 
                extremely advanced science? Show a Victorian-era child an ice-cold bottle of Mountain Dew. How does it 
                literally glow neon green? It must be magic. Therefore sorcery could be backed with some very very much 
                advanced, yet plausible, science. However, don't the Avatar people seem a bit primitive?
            </p>
            <h4>Spiral</h4>

            <p>
            It will be a reversion, cyclical like all things, like the spiral, get it SPIRituAL. So we will abandon 
            the guns and war ships for spears and arrows, we will sacrifice mass-production for hand-made artisan goods. 
            But we could never completely abandon modern technology for a truly acoustic life. Therefore a select few 
            will leave a new generation in a secluded area (imagine Maze Runner) raised faithful to this true religion 
            in which they will live a life without the poison of evil tech and greed. But aren't we banking too much on 
            human faith? Yes, over time people lose faith. Forget the old religion. And be left to the violent world of
            greed and materialistic pursuits. And the cycle will restart all over again.
